        <h3>
          Over the scarlet steam train's billowing smoke, there was a sign announcing that the Hogwarts Express would depart at eleven o’clock. The platform also had a distinct smell — one which lifted the spirits of young wizards who, like Harry
          Potter, look forward each summer to the start of term.
        </h3>
        <h3 SIZE="6">
          Though the platform was normally only used six days a year (round trips for the beginning and end of term, as well as the Christmas and Easter holidays), the platform on those days was awash with activity. Steam from the scarlet engine
          flooded the platform as cats wound their way around the wizards’ legs and owls hooted to each other, as hoardes of students and parents moved around through the steam “like dark ghosts”, their voices carrying through the mist.
        </h3>
        <h3>Finally, at 11:00, a whistle sounded announcing the train’s departure., and the hiss of the pistons filled the platform as the train began to move, creaking out of the station as family members stood on the platform and waved their
          children off to school. Nobody returned to the platform, then, for months — until the end of term, when it once again filled with wizards and a wizened old guard sat by the archway back to the Muggle world, making sure everyone got home
          without attracting too much attention.</h3>

                safe from muggle prosecution. Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts after dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake.Since then,
                Hogwarts educated most wizarding children in the United Kingdom and its surrounding areas,keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and muggles.

                <strong>Hogwarts was protected by numerous ancient spells, such as the Anti-Disapparition Jinx; this could, however, be overridden by the Headmaster (and Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes) when necessary. It was also unplottable and
                  bewitched so that, if Muggles approached the castle, all they would see would be a mouldering ruin with a sign warning them to keep out and that it was unsafe. The protective magic over Hogwarts was not only strong enough to
                  apparently resist the dispelling effects of the Taboo, but also to repel even talented Dark Wizards.</strong>

            <font face="Bradley Hand ITC" color="white" size="6">The Chamber of Secrets was allegedly created deep under the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle during the Medieval times by Salazar Slytherin, who disagreed with the other Hogwarts founders on
              the merits of
              blood purity. The Chamber of Secrets was home to an ancient Basilisk, which was intended to be used to purge the school of Muggle-born students. The entrance could be found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom on the second floor. In
              order to gain entrance one had to say "open" in Parseltongue, and a sink would open into a slide. While falling down the large, dark pipe, one could see hundreds of other pipes leading off. At the end of the pipe, one was launched
              into a damp, stone chamber. This room was stated to be "miles beneath the school" and under the Lake. This was where Tom Marvolo Riddle used his ability to speak Parseltongue and attack Harry Potter.

                low-ceilinged, dungeon-like room with greenish lamps and chairs. This dungeon extended partway under the lake. Off of this room also included the Slytherin Boys' Dormitory.

                the target of Lord Voldemort due to its potent ability to return him to full power. Suspecting danger, Albus Dumbledore set out Rubeus Hagrid to retrieve the Stone from Vault 713 at Gringotts Wizarding Bank the same day he
                took Harry Potter to Diagon Alley. That same day, Quirinus Quirrell, who was being used as the parasitic host of Lord Voldemort, broke into the bank, but failed to obtain the Stone.
                Thereafter, Hagrid brought the Stone to Hogwarts as requested, and Professors Pomona Sprout, Filius Flitwick, Minerva McGonagall, Quirinus Quirrell and Severus Snape, as well as Hagrid and Dumbledore themselves, each created
                their own separate chamber.

                easily hold all of the school's students, staff and guests. It had tall walls that reached up to the ceiling, which was enchanted to look like the sky above. It was the scene of Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort's final
                showdown, which was the Dark Lord's ultimate defeat. This was because the Elder Wand refuse to kill its true master, so Harry was not killed. Since Voldemort was now a mortal man, the curse rebounded on him, killing Tom
                Marvolo Riddle once and for all.
